I am a neuroscientist with a broad research interest in advancing individual-specific measurement and inference. This includes improving brain imaging measures within single individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and advancing existing statistical analyses tools for individual inference. My current work is focused on methods for defining individual-specific variations in functional brain networks, and examining how these brain network variants relate to individual differences in brain mechanisms and subsequent behavior.
